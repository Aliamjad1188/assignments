# Data Science Assignment - Batch -2

## Instructions
 + **Submission Deadline:**  [ insert Deadline] 
 + **Total:** _100_
  ## Asssignment Overview

  In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understading of key concepts in data science and apply theme to real-world scenario.
       
 #### **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis** (30 marks)

 #### Dataset Description

 Download the  dataset  provided  for this assignment. The dataset contains information about [describe the dataset].

### Questions :

 1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
 2. Preform basic explotary data analysis,
     inclueding summary statistics and data visualization.
 3. Identify any missing values and propose 
     a strategy to handle theme.
4. Create at least  two meaningfull visualizations 
     to represent the insights gained from the data.

### Task 2: Dataset Preprocessing (20)

#### Data Cleaning 
  1. Handle missing values based on the strategy proposed in task 1.
  2. Check for and handel any outliters in dataq set.
  3. 
   #### feature engineering
   1. Create a new feature [describe the new feature].
  4. Normalize  or standerise relivent feature.
$$  X normalized = {X-min(X)\over max(X)-min(X)}  $$
 Discuss the importance of normalization in the cotext of machine learning.

 3. Create a new feature (Z) that represents the intraction between two existing feature(X) and (Y) using the formulae:

$$ Z={X\over Y}$$
provide a breif explation of why you choose the features:

 # Task 3: Machine learning (30marks)

### Model building

 1. Split the dataset in the training and testing set .
2. Choose a suitable mchine learning algrothim and train model.
3. Evaluate the model's perfomance using appropriate matrics.

### Hyperparameter tuining
1. Experiment with hyperparameter tuining to improve the model's perfomance .
2. Discuss the impct of the  different hyperparameters on the model.

# **Task 4: Conculision and Recommendations** (20marks)

write a conculission based on your analysis and purpose any recomendations for future work.

# **Task 5:Advanced Analysis**_(25marks)_

### Question 4.1
Apply a leinear regression model to predict a target variable (Y) based on relevents features (X_1,X2,Xn). Evaluate the  model's performance using the Mean Squared Error(MSE) formula:

$$ MSE= {1 \over n}\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-Y_i)^2 $$

### Question 5.2

Discuss the strengths limitation of the linear regression model.purpose potential improvements.

## Mathemetics Formula's
   + ### ***Summation (sigma):*** $\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$
   + ### ***Theta  (&theta;):*** _&theta;_
   + ### ***pi(&pi;):*** _&pi;_
   + ### ***Logarithm(log):*** _log(x)_

# Submission guidelines
  1. Submit your assignement as a markdown file.
  2. Inclued any necessary code snippets in  the markdown.
  3. Clearly label each section with appropriate headings.
  4. Ensure your markdown file is well-formatted for readability.

   # Evaluate criteria: 
   Your assignment will be evaluated based on :
   
   + ### **Completeness :**  Did you adress all the tasks?
